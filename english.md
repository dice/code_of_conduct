##Code of Conduct##

Patchwork is a community event intended for education, networking and collaboration.

We value the participation of each member of the GitHub community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout all GitHub-sponsored events.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any GitHub event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

##The Short Version##

GitHub is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any presentation given at a GitHub event.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at a GitHub event.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the event managers.

Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.

##The Longer Version##

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance at GitHub events.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or conference with no refund.

##Contact Information##

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a GitHub employee or security officer.

GitHubbers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
